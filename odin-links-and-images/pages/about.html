  <p>This page covers common image formats </p>
 
 <h2>JPGs</h2>
 
 <p>JPG images are good for photos - 
  <ul>
    <li>they are designed for hardling large color palettes without increasing the file size too much</li>
    <li>i.e makes them great for photos with lots of gradients in them. But don't allow for transparent pixels.</li>
  </ul>
 </p>

 <h2>GIFs</h2>

<p>GIFs are good for animations.
  <ul>
    <li>The pesty trade-off is that they are limited in their color palette</li>
    <li>transparent are a binary option, therefore you cannot have a semi-opaque pixel</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>PNGs</h2>

<p>PNGs are good for diagrams and icons.
  <ul>
    <li>Generally bigger than jpg files</li>
    <li>deal with opacity fine and don't have color palette limiations</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>SVGs</h2>

<p>SVGs are <em>amazing</em>. Use them wherever you can.
  <ul>
    <li>vector-based graphics</li>
    <li>one potential issue - if images contain lots of text then has a big impact on file size</li>
  </ul>
</p>
